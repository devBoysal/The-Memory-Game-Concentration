# Udacity Memory Game Project 2 - Front End Web Development

This Project is apart of Udacity's Front End Web Development "Nanodegree".

*   The project had us create the classic memory game "Concentration".
    The task was to code the game either from scratch (what I have done) or with some html (a skeleton) already provided
    to structure the deck of cards (16 cards of 2 pairs.)
